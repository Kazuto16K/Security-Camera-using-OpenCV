This Security Camera project takes video feed from user's Webcam , and starts recording if it detects a human face/body. 
The program also sends an SMS to the target number with the help of Twilio.

The program is made such that if a person leaves the camera , it records for 5 seconds and then stops unless a human is detected again. Then recording stars again.

In this given code, the keys in the keys.py file are hidden for security purpose.
